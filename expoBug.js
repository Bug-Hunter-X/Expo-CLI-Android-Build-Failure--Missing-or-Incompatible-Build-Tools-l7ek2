This error occurs when using Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK build tools are not found or are of an incompatible version. This can happen even if the Android SDK is correctly installed and configured in the environment.  The problem often stems from inconsistencies between the Expo CLI's requirements and the system's actual Android SDK setup.
