The issue can be resolved by explicitly specifying the Android SDK build tools version using the `expo prebuild` command.  This ensures that the Expo CLI utilizes the correct build tools version.  For example: 
```bash
expo prebuild --android-sdk-build-tools-version=33.0.0
expo build:android
```
Replace `33.0.0` with the appropriate compatible version number. Refer to Expo's documentation for compatibility guidance; using an incompatible version can cause further build errors.  After running `expo prebuild` with the correct version, retry the `expo build:android` command.
